\chapter{Current progress}
\label{ch:current_progress}

In this chapter we explain our current results in the implementation of the proposed framework and
related tools. In section 4.1 we explain the progress made related each component proposed in the
framework.

\section{Framework progress}

We first start by the model edito, whose current state is shown the following figure. We are
at a 40\% percent progress related to this component, as the most difficult parts was the underlying
infrastructure needed to abstract away the physics backends. We have the UI working and ready to be
linked to the necessary commands to be implemented for the editor.

Then, the terrain generation tools are at a 50\%, and it is working with both Bullet and Mujoco
as physics backends. The following figures show the progress made with this components in both
engines.
